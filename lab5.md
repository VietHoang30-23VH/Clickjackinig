**Lab: Multistep clickjacking**
*-Goals:*
1. At this lab, User is protected by CSRF token and a confirmation dialog that clickjacking cannot work properly.
2. To solve this, we must create two elements that manage to overcome two confirmation actions.
3. Then, after all, we delete account to get success.
*-Analysis:*
1. These steps that approach to exploit server is similar to the others.
2. At this we might write more in `lab5.html`
